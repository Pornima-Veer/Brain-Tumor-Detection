# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the Deep Learning technique to perform image classification. In this paper, we compared two model CNN find the best model CNN to classify tumors in Brain MRI Images and at the end , I have trained CNN and  obtained a prediction accuracy of up to 99.99%.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging technique used to diagnosing brain tumor disease. Early diagnosis of brain tumors is an essential task in medical work to find out whether the tumor can potentially become cancerous.Deep Learning is a handy and efficint method for image classification. Deep Learning has been widely applied in various fields including medical imaging,because it's application does not require the reliability of an expert in the related field,but requires the amount of data and diverse data to produce good classification results.


The Dataset

   The dataset consists of two different folders that are 'Yes' or 'No'.Both the folders contain different MRI images of the patients.'Yes' folder has patient that have brain tumors wherehas 'No' folder contains images of patients with no brain tumor.
   There are total 155 images of other patients having no brain tumor.All the images are of 240*240 pixels.
