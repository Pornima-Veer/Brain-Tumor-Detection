# Brain-Tumor-Detection
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the Deep Learning technique to perform image classification. In this paper, we compared two model CNN find the best model CNN to classify tumors in Brain MRI Images and at the end , I have trained CNN and  obtained a prediction accuracy of up to 99.99%.
